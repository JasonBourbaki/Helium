####   You are going to come across a collection exhibiting isotopes of <a href="{{ 'about' | relative_url }}" title="About me">Jason He</a> (Get it?). Some are stable and serious, suitable for academic purposes; more of them have half-life of a split second, decaying into pages of ideas, fantasies, or rants, emitting outworldly radiation.

* #### Explore by the categories on the top menu bar. Don't you want to know what each isotope consists of?
