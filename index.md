### Hey visitor, you just wandered into a museum filled with volatile chemicals. 


#### You are going to come across a collection of isotopes of Jason He (Get it?). Some are stable and serious, capable for academic purposes; more of them have half-life of a split second, decaying into pages of ideas, fantasies, or rants, emitting crazy radiation.


#### Here are ways to navigate in this labyrinth:

* Explore by the categories on the top menu bar. Don't you want to know what each isotope consists of?

* <a href="{{ 'timeline' | relative_url }}" title="Timeline">View all the posts in chronological order;</a>

* Wanna dive right into something interesting? <a href="{{ 'random' | relative_url }}" title="Random Substance">Start from a random post.</a>
