    <h2><strong>Helium Two: Reality</strong></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Helium-2 is a considerably unstable isotope of helium that consists of solely two protons. Its dichotomous structure reminds me of our increasingly polarized socity, where people shut themselves up from the "others". Scientists have concluded that helium-2 would have been more stable if the strong force was two percent greater. Similarly, humanity would hold together better with 2% more love and understanding. This isotope of me comments on real-world events and tells stories about lovely people I encountered, in hope to plant a bit more happiness and faith in the readers' hearts.</h4>
